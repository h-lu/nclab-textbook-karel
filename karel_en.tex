{\bf Why Learn Computer Programming?}\\[2mm]
It is easy for a computer programmer to find a great job, and even to work 
remotely over the Internet from anywhere. Besides
that -- computer programming is lots of fun! Interacting 
with the computer will teach you {\em how to think}. It is much more about breaking problems into simpler ones, and thinking how 
to solve them, than about typing code on the keyboard. It is also about 
{\em humanity} -- you will be able to help many other people if you know how to use
computer technology.\\[2mm]

\noindent
{\bf Why Use a Training Programming Language?}\\[2mm]
Why spend time with a training programming language 
if you can learn with the "real stuff" such as C++ or Java? Indeed, these languages 
are much more powerful than Karel the Robot. They are also not graphical, have complicated 
syntax, and you will end up doing math calculations in no time. It will be hard, 
boring, and discouraging. On the other hand, Karel the Robot was designed to be 
{\em graphical}, have extremely {\em simple syntax}, and it {\em does not contain 
math}. Therefore, students can focus on what matters most -- their algorithmic 
thinking. This is a new skill that needs to be developed, and then the "real" 
programming languages become incredibly easy to learn. \\[2mm]

\noindent
{\bf Why a New Textbook?}\\[2mm]
Karel the Robot was created at the Stanford University by R.E. Pattis who also wrote 
the original textbook {\em Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming}
in the 1980s. His Karel was aimed at university-level students and its systax was influenced
by Pascal, a major "real" programming language of that era. We revived the language by using 
its original ideas, but our implementation is more oriented towards K-12 students and the syntax
is close to Python, a major programming language of today. \\[2mm]

\noindent
{\bf Become a Co-Author}\\[2mm]
This textbook is free and open source, and we do not plan to publish it via 
a commercial publisher. This would make it unnecessarily expensive. Feel 
free to contribute to the textbook with any material or 
suggestions. There is never enough illustrations and exercises, and there always 
are bugs to report. Translating the textbook into other languages would benefit
thousands of kids worldwide. Instructions for contributors can be found 
below.\\[2mm]

\newpage

\noindent
{\bf How to Contribute (for \LaTeX \ and Git users)}\\[2mm]
\noindent
The textbook is written in \LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system that 
you can learn and use in NCLab. In the future it will be possible to contribute to 
the textbook directly in NCLab, but at this time, the sources are stored 
in a public Git repository {\tt nclab-textbook-karel} at Github (http://github.com). \\[2mm]

\noindent
{\bf How to Contribute (for all others)}\\[2mm]
\noindent
We will gladly accept new interesting exercises for Karel and/or Python, as well as
new images of good quality that will make the textbook more interesting and fun. You
can send those at any time via email to {\tt pavel@femhub.com}.\\[2mm]

\section*{Foreword}

This course is based on the educational programming language {\em Karel the Robot}
that was created by R.E. Pattis at Stanford University. Karel is {\em graphical} which makes 
programming fun. It has {\em extremely simple syntax} which makes it easy to write code, 
and it {\em does not contain math}. With Karel, students understand quickly that computer 
programming is mostly about {\em thinking} and {\em solving problems}. After 
developing these skills, learning other programming languages becomes much easier. 

The NCLab implementation of Karel provides a Manual Mode, three Programming Modes, and 
Bonus Problems. In Manual Mode, kids as little as three years of age can guide the 
robot by clicking on buttons. On the other hand, any K-12 student who sends us an original 
solution to a Bonus Problem receives an NCLab T-Shirt. 

\subsection*{How to Learn with Karel}

The best way to learn with Karel is to solve assignments which are accessible through 
Karel's File menu, using this textbook as a reference.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Accessing assignments through Karel's File menu.}
\label{fig:f1a}
\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}
\noindent
These assignments come in the form of simple games with concrete goals to fulfill, 
and certain limitations on time, maximum number of steps, etc. 
Fig. \ref{fig:f1} shows sample assignment {\em Diamond Mine} in Manual Mode.
\newpage
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/fore-1.png}
\end{center}
\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Sample game {\em Diamond Mine} in Manual Mode.}
\label{fig:f1}
\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}
\noindent
The five buttons available in Manual Mode include 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt go} (make one step forward), 
\item {\tt left} (turn left), 
\item {\tt right} (turn right), 
\item {\tt put} (put a gem on the ground),
\item {\tt get} (pick up a gem from the ground).
\end{itemize} 
In the Programming Modes, students solve assignments by typing code
instead of clicking on buttons. For example, Programming Mode 1 comes 
with the commands 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt go}, {\tt left}, {\tt right}, {\tt put}, {\tt get}
\end{itemize} 
whose functions correspond to the five buttons in Manual Mode, and 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt repeat} (repeat one or more commands a given number of times).
\end{itemize} 
Programming Mode 2 brings sensors, conditions, conditional loop, and ability to define 
custom commands. Programming Mode 3 moreover provides variables, GPS device, Python lists 
to store the robot's path, advanced logical operations, and more. Complete overview 
of functionality by Programming Mode can be found in Section \ref{sec:newfunc3}
